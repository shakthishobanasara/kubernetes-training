# Comparing Kubernetes Secrets, Sealed Secrets, and External Secrets Operator (ESO)

This document explains the differences between **native Kubernetes Secrets**, **Sealed Secrets**, and **External Secrets Operator (ESO)** ‚Äî focusing on use cases, security, and GitOps workflows.

---

## 1. Kubernetes Secrets

**What they are**  
- Native Kubernetes object (`kind: Secret`) for storing sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, and keys.
- Data is only **base64 encoded**, not encrypted by default.

**Pros**
- Built-in, no extra setup.
- Easy to consume from Pods via `envFrom`, `env`, or `volumeMounts`.
- Supported by all Kubernetes tooling.

**Cons**
- Only base64-encoded ‚Üí anyone with YAML or cluster read access can see real values.
- Not safe to commit into Git repositories.
- Relies on etcd encryption-at-rest + RBAC for real security.

**Best use case**  
‚û°Ô∏è Quick, simple secret management in non-critical or internal clusters (with strong RBAC).

---

## 2. Sealed Secrets (Bitnami)

**What they are**  
- A **controller + CLI (`kubeseal`)** that encrypts a Secret into a **SealedSecret** custom resource.
- Encrypted using the cluster‚Äôs public key, only decrypted inside the cluster.

**Pros**
- Safe to commit to Git (GitOps-friendly).
- Encrypted at rest, not just base64.
- Developers/CI can generate SealedSecrets without accessing plaintext secrets inside the cluster.

**Cons**
- Adds another controller to manage.
- Encryption is **cluster-specific** ‚Äî sealed secrets for one cluster won‚Äôt work in another.
- Rotation of the controller‚Äôs keypair requires re-sealing secrets.
- Secrets still end up as native `Secret` objects in the cluster (plaintext in-memory).

**Best use case**  
‚û°Ô∏è GitOps pipelines where secrets must live in Git safely (e.g., ArgoCD, FluxCD setups).

---

## 3. External Secrets Operator (ESO)

**What it is**  
- A Kubernetes operator that **syncs external secret managers** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.) into Kubernetes Secrets.
- Instead of storing secrets in Git, the cluster fetches them securely at runtime.

**Pros**
- No secrets in Git at all.
- Centralized management in existing enterprise secret stores.
- Supports rotation and auditing natively in the external system.
- Can reference secrets dynamically via CRDs like `ExternalSecret`.

**Cons**
- Requires external secret manager setup (Vault, AWS SM, etc.).
- More moving parts (IAM roles, service accounts, networking).
- Secrets still materialize as plain Kubernetes `Secret` objects (same as with Sealed Secrets).

**Best use case**  
‚û°Ô∏è Enterprises already using a cloud secret manager (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vault) who want **GitOps without secrets in Git**.

## üîë Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                | Kubernetes Secrets         | Sealed Secrets              | External Secrets Operator (ESO)         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Security**            | Base64 only (weak)        | Encrypted (cluster key)     | Secure (backed by external KMS/Vault)   |
| **GitOps-friendly**     | ‚ùå No                     | ‚úÖ Yes (commit encrypted)    | ‚úÖ Yes (no secrets in Git at all)       |
| **Setup**               | None (built-in)           | Install controller + `kubeseal` | Install ESO + external secret manager |
| **Secret rotation**     | Manual                    | Requires re-sealing         | Automatic via external manager          |
| **Multi-cluster**       | Hard (copy secrets)       | ‚ùå Cluster-specific only     | ‚úÖ Yes (ESO fetches per cluster)        |
| **Auditability**        | Minimal                   | Some (Git history encrypted)| Strong (audit in Vault/AWS SM etc.)     |
| **Consumption in Pods** | Direct (env/volumes)      | Same (becomes Secret)       | Same (becomes Secret)                   |

## üöÄ Recommendations

- **For simple/lab clusters** ‚Üí use **Kubernetes Secrets** with RBAC + etcd encryption enabled.
- **For GitOps-first teams** ‚Üí use **Sealed Secrets** to commit encrypted secrets safely in Git.
- **For enterprises/cloud-native orgs** ‚Üí use **ESO** with Vault/AWS SM/GCP SM for full rotation, audit, and multi-cluster support.
